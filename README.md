# CRM-Lead-Analysis
Analyzed 19,533 requests from CRM.
87.4% were unsuccessful, about 5.8% were not processed at all.
Average time from creation to closure — **167.9 days**.
Found **2 requests** that were stuck without movement for more than 3 days.
For leads in progress, I calculated the acceptance time: **16115.9 hours** (~671 days) — a serious signal for process optimization.
The data was cleaned, marked by status, visualized using Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Task management was conducted through the **Jira Kanban board**.
